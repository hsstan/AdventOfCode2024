# Advent Of Code 2024

This Year I choose to try Python to solve Advent of Code puzzles and make my solutions available for anyone

# The Setup

No local installation needed. Set up a Github Repository then open codespace and add Dev Container configuration file for python

every solution will be structured in a folder dayXX with at least the following files:
* readme.md - with the link at the specific Advent of Code day
* input.txt - containing the input required
* task1.py - containing the solution of first part
* task2.py - containing the solution of second part

# Enjoy it and comment :)
